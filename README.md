### Documentation

All documentation (GDD, surveys, notes, etc.) will be maintained on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1wZfKsCMxFXs1D0v6773a8cE5PwrfDy2c?usp=sharing).

### Communication

We'll use [Discord](https://discord.gg/fKvweVH9CU) for chatting, screen-share, debugging, etc.

## Task Management

We will work in an Agile-like approach, using the tools integrated within GitHub for easy tracking. We have the following setup:
 - No direct commits to `main` branch is allowed.
   - Work should be done on feature branches and merged via a pull request, which requires at least one other member to review.
   - This ensures that we don't accidentally break the entire game, as well as bugs are quickly found.
 - A [Kanban board](https://github.com/vinayg-usc/games-project/projects) for tracking all open features/bugs.
   - Each week, we will review the backlog here to prioritize/assign tasks as required.
